## Events of the Week

The week with "Moscow 2030"
"Moscow 2030" is not just an exhibition, it’s a window into the future!

As an IT specialist, I was amazed by the scale and depth of the innovations presented. Technologies that seemed like science fiction just yesterday are already becoming reality today!

Virtual reality, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles – all of this and more demonstrate that we are on the verge of a new era.

And I eagerly anticipate the technological breakthroughs that lie ahead in the future!
