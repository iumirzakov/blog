## About Me

I was born on May 18, 2005, in Tashkent, Chilanzar district, 3rd block.

I received my secondary education at Mirzo Ulugbek Gymnasium in the capital of the country.

From an early age, I played football, and by the age of 16, I was called to the national youth team.

At 18, I moved to Moscow to become a student at RUDN University. By the beginning of 2024, I started working at Alfa Bank, thus beginning my journey in a new city.
